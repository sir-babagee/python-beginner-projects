hello i am typing random stuff so that I can try and test my
graph composer code if it works. So as you're reading this please let yourself go and just
go with the flow of how things are. Say, have you been well? When was the last time you 
enjoyed yourself. You know, go out and do stuff that makes you happy. If it's been then
you should go out pretty soon. Meet people, discuss your hobbies, fall in love, be in a relationship
and stuff. You know how it goes. I shouldn't be here telling you what you should do. It's okay. Be FREE!!
